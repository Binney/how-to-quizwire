        <h1>Lesson 7: Making a Quiz Website</h1>

        <p>The time has come for us to start work on our main project: we're going to make a quiz game!</p>

        <div class="actions">Create a new empty file and call it quiz.html. Then, create another and call it quiz.js.</div>

        <p>For this project, we're going to use a tool called JQuery. It'll make Javascript easier to write.</p>

        <div class="actions">Visit <a href="http://jquery.com/download/">the JQuery website</a> and click "Download the compressed, production JQuery". Save that file to your work experience folder.</div>

        <p>If you open up that file, you'll see it's very hard to read! But JQuery is just another Javascript file - like the ones you've been writing.

            Now we'll include it in our HTML:</p>

        <div class="code">
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="jquery-3.2.1.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        </div>

        <p>(If the numbers at the end of your filename are different, make the src match the version in your folder.)

            And also include your own Javascript file, so you'll get something like this:</p>

        <div class="code">
    &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="jquery-3.2.1.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="quiz.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
        </div>

        <div class="pagination">
            <a href='lesson6.html'>&#8592; Click here to go back to lesson 6</a>
            &#2022;
            <a>Lesson 8 doesn't exist yet &#8594;</a>
        </div>

    </div>
    <script src="lesson7_demos.js"></script>
    <script src="lesson7.js"></script>
