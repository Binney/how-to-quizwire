    <h1>Writing HTML</h1>

    <p>Now let's build our own websites.</p>

	<h2>What is a website?</h2>
    <p>All websites are different, but they all have the same structure. It's a bit like a human being: it has a head and a body.</p>

    <img src="webpage_structure.jpg">
    <div class="actions">Look at the head and body of this web page using Developer Tools. What's the difference?</div>

	<h2>Side note: What is a file extension and what does it do?</h2>

    <p>You've seen loads of file extensions before: jpg, gif, doc, html. They're stored on the end of the name of files stored on your computer. If you can't see them, you'll need to go to View &gt; check the "File name extensions" box.</p>

    <p>A file extension tells the computer how a file should be opened, for example if you open a file with an .html extension your computer will try to open it in a web browser (because .html files are web pages). But that doesn't mean we can't force the computer to open a file in something else.</p>

    <div class="actions"></div>

	<h2>New tasks</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Make a new file in your work experience folder. Call it about.html</li>
		<li>Fill it with some facts about you</li>
		<li>Use a link tag to make a link to your new page.</li>
    </ul>
