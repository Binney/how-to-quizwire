        <h1>Making your web site interactive with Javascript</h1>

        <p>Now we're going to write some real code! Javascript is a super useful language that almost every computer in the world can "speak": it's used to interact with a web page.</p>
        
        <h2>How to add a Javascript script</h2>

        <p>First, you create a new Javascript file. Then you tell your web page to run that Javascript.</p>

        <div class="actions">Create an empty new file and call it script.js. Save it in the same folder as your lesson4.html.</div>

        <p>This is a Javascript file! We'll be writing Javascript and then your web browser will run it. Try writing this in your script.js:</p>

        <div class="code">
alert("Hello, world!");
        </div>

        <p>Now we have to tell your web page to run this Javascript like a script. You do this with the special "script" tag:</p>

        <div class="code">
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="script.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        </div>

        <p>Try loading up the web page in your browser. You should see a popup message, nicely done!</p>

        <h2>What do you use Javascript for?</h2>

        <p>You can use Javascript to replace part of a web page. For instance, using document.getElementById("myDiv")</p>

        <p>Create a button, and use the onClick handler to connect it to a function.</p>

        <h2>What's a function?</h2>

        <p>You might have come across the word "function" in maths. There, it means a process where you can put a number in one end and get a number out the other end.</p>

        <img src="Illustration here">

        <p>Well, in computing functions are much the same. You send inputs in one end, and outputs come out the other end. 
            
            Here's an example of a Javascript function which multiplies two numbers together:</p>

        <div class="code">
function multiply(x, y) {
    return x * y;
}
        </div>

        <div class="actions">Copy this function into your Javascript file and save it.</div>

        <p>Let's examine it more closely. We start with "function", because guess what, it's a function. "multiply" is the name of the function.

            Then, we have (x, y). These are our inputs, which in computing we call <span class="keyword">arguments</span>.

            Finally we use the word <span class="keyword">return</span> for our outputs.
        </p>

        <div class="actions">Open your HTML in the browser, and go to the Javascript console.</div>

        <p>You can <span class="keyword">call</span> the function like this:</p>

        <div class="code">
console.log(multiply(2, 3));
        </div>

        <p>Try it out! Go to the console and type out "multiply(2,3)" and hopefully you'll see 6.</p>
