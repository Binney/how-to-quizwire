	<h1>The CSS Challenge</h1>
	<p>So you've learned some CSS? Time to put it to the test!

	You're going to download a sample HTML page, which looks <a href="sample.html">like this.</a></p>

	<div class="actions">Right click <a href="sample.html">this link</a> and select "Save link as..." then save it to your work folder.</div>

	<p>Open the version of the web page on your own computer and compare it to the one online. You'll notice they look pretty different:</p>

	<table class="table-no-borders">
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>
					<img src="challenges/screenshot_with_css.jpg" style="height: 500px">
				</td>
				<td>
					<img src="challenges/screenshot_without_css.jpg" style="height: 500px">
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="captions">
				<td>Online version</td>
				<td>What you're (hopefully) seeing on your own version</td>
		</tbody>
	</table>

	<p>That's because <a href="sample.html">the version online</a> has a CSS file which changes its appearance, whereas the one on your computer doesn't.</p>

	<div class="actions">Make a new empty CSS file: File &gt; New File then File &gt; Save As and call it style.css. Make sure it's saved in the same folder as your sample HTML.</div>

	<p>Your challenge - should you choose to accept it - is this:</p>

	<div class="challenge">Write your own CSS to make your version of the site match the one online.</div>

	<p>You'll get points according to how similar your website looks to the online version, so keep your eyes peeled for differences between the two!

	Every CSS attribute you'll need is in the table on the sample page. Go through them one by one and google them to find out what they do and how to use them.</p>

	<div class="actions">Each time you learn how to use an attribute, fill in that row in your table with an example value and a description of how to use it. I've already done one for you.</div>

	<p>If you get stuck, ask Sarah for help or cheat using Developer Tools! You can check the CSS that's applying to a web page by right clicking on the page and selecting Inspect.

	Good luck!</p>
